**********		WHAT ALL DOES THE FILE CONTAIN			**********  

The .py (Python) file in each of the exercise in the given project contains 3 things :

1.	Problem Statement 	: 		It is the complete description of problem. It explains what we have to do in the exercise .
2.	Solution			:		It is the code written in PYTHON version 3 . ( It will compile and give desired output only if you are working in environment 
								running  on Python 3. Other it may give syntax error or undesired result  )
3.	Key Points			:		These are the points that will help you to understand the working of the solution.
