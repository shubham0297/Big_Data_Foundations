Exercise 2.7			DATA DISTRIBUTION KIND

Problem Statement :

The data you just plotted is in what kind of distribution? Is there a difference in distribution between rainy and non-rainy days?


Solution :

The data plotted in the above histogram is in Skewed Distribution(Asymmetrical,outcome is more on one side).To be more specific it is a Right-Skewed Distribution. Although both the distributions are right-skewed,we can spot a difference in the distribution between rainy and non-rainy days. The number of ENTRIESn_hourly is less on rainy days as compared to that in rainy days.
